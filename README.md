## Notes 
- Each chapter (where Automatic test is applicable) has a commit named 'Up to Chapter x' saying what has been completed up to and including chapter x.

- Ran into a small hiccup with the GitHub DeskTops gitignore for Django as it included the media folder which makes sense for a normal project however in this case it caused the Unit Tests for Chapter 4 to fail (as the media file can't be found) - so I moved this chapter to a new branch and added and pushed the media files to the repo :)


- Was originally part of the Univercity Repo but thought moving it out to it's own repo would be easier for automatic testing etc.
